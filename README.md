According to a [blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/) by Github, 
> Maintainers of popular open source projects / repositories will get access to Copilot for free. 

In order to become eligible you need `write` access to a popular repository which is kind of hard to achieve :c. 

But that's where we come in, [@InimicalPart](https://github.com/inimicalpart) and I ([@1RB](https://github.com/1RB)) have created this repo where **all of you** will get write access 🎉.

But thats only the first step, the second step is to become a **popular repository** and in order for that to happen we need **your help**!

## What To Do

1. :star: this repo as it is one of the first ways to know how popular a repo is.
2. Create a folder with your username this will be your workspace. `Eg. /<username>`
3. Inside your workspace create a README file. `Eg. /<username>/README.md`
4. Write a little bit about yourself and commit the file to the repository. *You may use [this]() template*
5. Share this repo around to fellow developers who are looking to get this amazing product for free.

> ***Unfortunately as this is a new project it may take a bit to gain traction and for Github to recognise it as an active popular repo.***
