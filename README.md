*****‚ÄºÔ∏èIMPORTANT‚ÄºÔ∏è** Once you get your collaborator role, you will need to commit to your workspace at least once a month in order to retain your role. This is to keep the repository "active" so other people can also get Copilot.***
<br /><br />‚ùóPlease read the full [Terms of Use](/terms_of_use.md) carefully before using the repository. 

## The Plan

According to a [blog](https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/) by Github, 
> Maintainers of popular open source projects / repositories will get 12 month access to Copilot for free.

In order to become eligible you need `write` access to a popular repository which is kind of hard to achieve ü•≤ and that's where we come in, [@InimicalPart](https://github.com/inimicalpart) and I ([@1RB](https://github.com/1RB)) have created this repo where **all of you** will get write access üéâ.
<br /> But thats only the first step, the second step is to become a ‚ú®**popular repository**‚ú® and in order for that to happen we need **your help**!

## What To Do

1. :star: this repo as it is one of the first ways to know how popular a repo is.
2. Open the [`Contributors`](/Contributors/) folder
2. Create a folder with your username inside the folder, this will be **your workspace**. (`Eg. Contributors/<username>/`)
3. Inside your workspace create a README file. (`Eg. Contributors/<username>/README.md`)
4. Write a little bit about yourself and create a pull request with the file to the repository. *You may use [this](/TEMPLATE.md) template*
4. [@LimitlyAI](https://github.com/LimitlyAI) will review your changes and inform you if any changes are to be made. 
7. Once everything looks good check your emails as you should receive an invite in your emails to become a collaborator.
6. Share this repo around to fellow developers who are looking to get this amazing product for free.

*****‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è**: To reduce the number of trolls, we will not be allowing commits to files outside of your workspace***
